          The First Age, often called the Elder Days, was the first historical
          era in Arda that began with the Awakening of the Elves in YT 1050 and
          ended with the final overthrow of Morgoth after the War of Wrath, when
          he was banished from Arda into the Void. However, despite the fact
          that most of the First Age spanned through the Years of the Trees, for
          the purpose of convenience this article covers its last 590 solar
          years which followed the first sunrise.

        <p>
          J.R.R. Tolkien described primarily the events of the First Age that
          occurred in Beleriand. These were centered on a series of wars waged
          by the Sindar, the Ñoldor and the Three Houses of the Edain (Mankind),
          against the power of Morgoth. The wars had begun in the Years of the
          Trees, but were refreshed after the arrival of the Ñoldor in
          Beleriand. There had been Elves in Beleriand for uncounted millennia,
          but who were passive, and Morgoth had little to do with them. The
          Ñoldor, on the other hand, particularly the Sons of Fëanor, had come
          with the express purpose of opposing Morgoth.

          After the destruction of Two Trees of Valinor, the Valar made the Sun
          and the Moon out of the final fruit of Laurelin and the final flower
          of Telperion and set them in the heavens. That began The Years of the
          Sun, and Men awoke at the first rising of the first Sun.
        </p>

        <p>
          After Men awoke and the Sun started its way through heavens, the First
          Age continued for about another 590 years. It ended with the final
          overthrow of Morgoth by the Valar in the War of Wrath, after the
          voyage of Eärendil. After that time every following Age was counted in
          the Years of the Sun exclusively.
